# 100 Days Of Code - Log
My #100DaysOfCode challenge is concentrated towards making me a better person, do what I wanted to do and basically have good enough memories for 2018.
The target is to work on the following challenges by giving at least one hour a day and that too with full time job:
1) Learning DS: Learning Data Science (Why is it so famous, what is in there technically and learn it since I've always liked studying and working with data)
2) Improving Backend: Getting a certificate from freeCodeCamp in NodeJS (always wished to learn NodeJS) or more
3) Improving Frontend: Improve learning of frontend libraries
4) Giving back to the society: This include any kind of contribution, since we take a lot from them as well 
5) Anything else: If I spend time learning/doing something that compensates for not doing anything from above

### Day 0: October 23, Tuesday

##### Today's Progress: 
1) Improving Backend: Finished first module of NodeJS from freeCodeCamp
2) Learning DS: Auditing course on coursera. Watched 1.5 modules of [What is Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/what-is-datascience/home/welcome)

##### Thoughts:
- Got a better understanding of semantic versioning and difference between Major, Minor and Patches and how to upgrade to them.
- Got an overview of Data Science, its applications, its market demand is pretty high, and there are people from diverse backgrounds working in this field.
- Learnt about Hadoop (an inspiration of Google's page rank algorithm)
- Learnt about Data Mining important pillars preprocessing(taking care of erroneous and missing data), transforming (to feasible form, convert variables into other variables or categoriest), storing (cloud is the winner) and then mining data.

### Day 1: October 24, Wednesday

##### Today's Progress:
1) Improving Backend: Covered second module of freeCodeCamp
2) Giving back to the society: Reported an issue on freeCodeCamp docs repository

- The glitch platform is lovely where I can code the Javascript and see the results without doing anything.
- Found an issue (broken link) on freeCodeCamp and reported it on their public repository. I also sent a PR to fix the issue

##### Links to Work

##### Thoughts 
- Ran different flavors of queries from NodeJS including find, update, delete than some fancy ones like findOne, findAndUpdate etc 
- Got overview of Neural Networks and Deep Learning (also called Deep Neural Network) which basically helped in natural language processing and image processing etc
- Deep Neural network is when you have many many hidden layers (10s to 100s) in between Neural Networks

3. Giving back: Merged the PRs of my [Hacktoberfest](https://github.com/ows-ali/Hacktoberfest) repository which were pending due to merge conflicts or minor issues, I resolved them myself. But I am really hopeful that those who did not add their names in README will come back and make a PR for that so that it becomes a good memory as well :)

##### Thoughts
