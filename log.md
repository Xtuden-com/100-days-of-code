# 100 Days Of Code - Log
My #100DaysOfCode challenge is concentrated towards making me a better person, do what I wanted to do and basically have good enough memories for 2018.
The target is to work on the following challenges by giving at least one hour a day and that too with full time job:
1) Learning DS: Learning Data Science (Why is it so famous, what is in there technically and learn it since I've always liked studying and working with data)
2) Improving Backend: Getting a certificate from freeCodeCamp in NodeJS (always wished to learn NodeJS) or more
3) Improving Frontend: Improve learning of frontend libraries
4) Giving back to the society: This include any kind of contribution, since we take a lot from them as well 
5) Anything else: If I spend time learning/doing something that compensates for not doing anything from above

### Day 0: October 23, Tuesday

##### Today's Progress: 
1) Improving Backend: Finished first module of NodeJS from freeCodeCamp
2) Learning DS: Auditing course on coursera. Watched 1.5 modules of [What is Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/what-is-datascience/home/welcome)

##### Thoughts:
- Got a better understanding of semantic versioning and difference between Major, Minor and Patches and how to upgrade to them.
- Got an overview of Data Science, its applications, its market demand is pretty high, and there are people from diverse backgrounds working in this field.
- Learnt about Hadoop (an inspiration of Google's page rank algorithm)
- Learnt about Data Mining important pillars preprocessing(taking care of erroneous and missing data), transforming (to feasible form, convert variables into other variables or categoriest), storing (cloud is the winner) and then mining data.

- [Intro to Managing Packages with npm ](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/apis-and-microservices/managing-packages-with-npm)


### Day 1: October 24, Wednesday

##### Today's Progress:
1) Improving Backend: Covered second module of freeCodeCamp
2) Giving back to the society: Reported an issue on freeCodeCamp docs repository

##### Thoughts 
- The glitch platform is lovely where I can code the Javascript and see the results without doing anything.
- Found an issue (broken link) on freeCodeCamp and reported it on their public repository. I also sent a PR to fix the issue

##### Links to Work

### Day 2: October 25, Thursday

##### Today's Progress:
1) Improving Backend: Covered more than half of third module of freeCodeCamp certificate
2) Anything else: Spent time with friends to discuss idea about Startup and how we can actually start it

##### Thoughts 
- Created Database of MongoDB on mLab, basically on cloud. 
- Connected MongoDB and performed some queries, i had done very little queries in NodeJS earlier but just refreshed the memory and learnt more concepts

### Day 3: October 26, Friday

##### Today's Progress:
1. Improving Backend: Completed 4th and final module of freeCodeCamp certificate (Achievement)
2. Learning DS: Completed next module of Intro to Data Science
3. Giving back: Created PRs in FreeCodeCamp's repository to contribute into documents and fixed a typo in Exercism.io (merged already)

##### Thoughts 
- Ran different flavors of queries from NodeJS including find, update, delete than some fancy ones like findOne, findAndUpdate etc 
- Got overview of Neural Networks and Deep Learning (also called Deep Neural Network) which basically helped in natural language processing and image processing etc
- Deep Neural network is when you have many many hidden layers (10s to 100s) in between Neural Networks

### Day 4: October 27, Saturday

##### Today's Progress:
1. Improving Backend: Completed the 1/4 project for certificate of 'Api and Microservices' by FreeCodeCamp

##### Thoughts 
- Learnt about time conversion and one step closer towards certificate and making bigger projects with NodeJS.


### Day 5: October 28, Sunday

##### Today's Progress:
1. Improving Backend: Completed the 2/4 project for certificate of 'Api and Microservices' by FreeCodeCamp

##### Thoughts 
- Parsed user info like ip, browser etc from request header
- Tried deploying on Heroku but build was failing so will do it tomorrow

#### Links to work:

### Day 7: October 28, Sunday

##### Today's Progress:
1. Improving Backend:The 2/4 project for certificate of 'Api and Microservices' by FreeCodeCamp is live on Heroku. Started 3/4 project but there was low voltage issue occured so was not able to continue work.

##### Thoughts 
- Deployed project to Heroku 1st and 2nd projects on Heroku
